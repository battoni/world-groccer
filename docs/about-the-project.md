# World Groccer

This project was a challenge proposed by [OfferFit](https://www.offerfit.ai/) to demonstrate my expertise in front-end development. The task involved develop a dashboard and using a mock dataset display key results to the end client, allowing me to showcase my knowledge and skills in this domain.

## üìú The history

World Grocer is a premium grocery chain. For several months, you have been working with World Grocer to implement a next-generation marketing personalization solution. The solution uses advanced statistical techniques to recommend which offer to send each customer to maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

The upcoming pilot consists of a development period followed by a 2-month ‚Äúgo live & measure uplift‚Äù period. You have been asked to develop a data visualization tool to enable World Grocer stakeholders to analyze the performance over the course of the go-live period.
