# ðŸ”‘ Core concepts

Before starting to code the components and features, I invested some time in creating a solid and scalable architecture.

I believe that this step is important to increase maintainability, improve the developer experience and performance, keep the code well formatted and following good standards and the best practices, and then improve the overall performance of the app.

During the development of the app, the following architecture concepts were kept in mind:

- [The Component Driven Design](https://www.componentdriven.org/)
- [The Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html)
- [S.O.L.I.D](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-explained-in-plain-english/)
- [D.R.Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
- [K.I.S.S](https://dev.to/kwereutosu/the-k-i-s-s-principle-in-programming-1jfg)
- [Clean code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/clean-coding-for-beginners/)
- [The Visual Test Driven Development](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/visual-testing-handbook/react/en/vtdd/)
- [Modular Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_pattern)

How all of this was bound together? Let's find out in the next article!
